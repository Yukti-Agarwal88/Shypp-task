# shypp_task

This is a basic README file for a Flutter app that focuses on building a simple user interface (UI) using Flutter framework.

## Getting Started

To run this app on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Flutter installed on your machine. If not, follow the Flutter installation guide: [Flutter Installation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
2. Clone this repository or download the source code as a ZIP file.
3. Open the project in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code or Android Studio.
4. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
      
      flutter pub get
      
5. Connect a physical device or start an emulator/simulator.
6. Run the app using the following command:

      flutter run
       
   This will build and run the app on the connected device/emulator.
   
## App Structure

The app follows a simple structure with the following key files and directories:

1. lib/main.dart: The entry point of the application. It initializes the app and defines the root widget.
2. lib/screens: This directory contains individual screen files. In this task, we have a screens named home_page.dart, my_loads.dart, ongoing_view.dart, order_details.dart, past_screen.dart. You can create additional screens and organize them in this directory.
3. lib/widgets: This directory contains reusable widgets that are used across different screens. In this task, we have a custom button, bottomSheet and card widget. Feel free to add more custom widgets as your app grows.
4. lib/utils: This directory contains reusable assets and colors.
